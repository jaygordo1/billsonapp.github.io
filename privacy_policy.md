**Billson App**
**Last Updated: February 12, 2026**

## Introduction

Billson App ("we," "our," or "us") operates a content management platform that enables users to publish video content to TikTok and manage advertising authorizations. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our application.

## Information We Collect

**Account Information:** When you connect your TikTok account, we collect your basic profile information (username, display name, and account ID) as authorized through TikTok's OAuth authentication.

**Content Data:** We process video files and associated metadata (captions, hashtags) that you provide for publishing to TikTok. Videos are stored temporarily during the upload process and are not retained after successful publication unless otherwise specified.

**Authentication Tokens:** We store OAuth access tokens and refresh tokens necessary to interact with TikTok's API on your behalf. These tokens are stored securely and encrypted at rest.

**Usage Data:** We collect basic usage logs including timestamps of actions performed, post IDs, and Spark Ads authorization codes generated through our platform.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information solely to:

- Authenticate your TikTok account and maintain your session
- Upload and publish video content to TikTok on your behalf
- Generate and retrieve Spark Ads authorization codes for your published content
- Provide you with reports and summaries of your posted content and ad codes
- Improve and maintain the functionality of our application

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.

## TikTok Data

Our application interacts with TikTok's API in accordance with TikTok's Developer Terms of Service. We only access TikTok data that you have explicitly authorized through the OAuth consent flow. We do not access or store data from other TikTok users.

## Data Storage and Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information, including encryption of stored credentials, secure HTTPS connections for all API communications, and restricted access controls. Authentication tokens are stored in encrypted environment files and are never exposed in logs or client-side code.

## Data Retention

- **Video files:** Deleted from our servers immediately after successful upload to TikTok
- **Authentication tokens:** Retained for the duration of your active session and refreshed as needed; revoked upon disconnection of your account
- **Post metadata and Spark codes:** Retained for as long as you maintain an active account, or until you request deletion
- **Usage logs:** Retained for up to 90 days for troubleshooting purposes

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Access the personal data we hold about you
- Request correction of inaccurate data
- Request deletion of your data
- Revoke TikTok API access at any time through your TikTok account settings
- Export your data in a machine-readable format

## Third-Party Services

Our application integrates with TikTok's platform. Your use of TikTok is governed by TikTok's own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. We encourage you to review TikTok's privacy practices at https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy.

## Children's Privacy

Our application is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated policy with a revised "Last Updated" date.
